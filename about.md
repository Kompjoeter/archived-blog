# I like to go on the computer.
Not pee, but play. The computer is my all time favorite pastime thing! 

I love exploring new software, creating  [digital art](https://www.artstation.com/kompjoeterjonk), and playing games. Since a few years now I'm leveling up! Learning to code and making cool, weird and sometimes useful programs myself.

Other than that I'm constantly developing new or improved strategies to stay optimally focused, productive yet healthy, while living with an ADHD brain. 

While I do mean to share about my own findings, I'm always interested to learn more about ADHD, and ADHD & productivity. Hit me up!
