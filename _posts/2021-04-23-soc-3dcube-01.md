## What now?

Recently I started working on a little experiment. When swiping through 'stories' on Instagram I noticed that when you hold your finger down and swipe left to switch to the stories of a different account, these are displayed on the next face of a 3D rectangle. I wondered how this display was made and decided to try it out myself.

After some googling I was able to throw a quick prototype together, on which I hooked up some basic canvas animations.

[Here's a video of the prototype in action](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhnaG788cOQ)

This is that experiment. The 3D Cube is made with HTML and CSS. It can be rotated by mouse or touch using the [hammer.js library](https://hammerjs.github.io/) and it uses the [p5.js library](https://p5js.org/) to display generative art on its sides.

## Multiple p5.js instances! How?

Each side of the cube is represented by a simple 'div'. This div can contain text, an image, and even an [HTML Canvas](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp). 

```  
  <div class="cube-container">      
    <div id="cube">
      <div class="face front">
        <div id="canvas-container-front"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="face back">
        <div id="canvas-container-back"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="face right">
        <div id="canvas-container-right"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="face left">
        <div id="canvas-container-left"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="face top">
        <div id="canvas-container-top"></div>
      </div>
      <div class="face bottom">
        <div id="canvas-container-bottom"></div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
```

Displaying a canvas in a div and running p5.js with generative art is not a big problem. Most of the work goes into coding the art generation. However, when you mean to use multiple instances of p5.js, thus, deploying multiple canvases, things get tricky. Especially when you want these different canvases/p5.js instances to interact with eachother.

An [instance of p5.js](https://p5js.org/examples/instance-mode-instantiation.html) is not global. All it's functionality and variables are scoped within the instance and can't be accessed from within other instances. However, any other non-p5 variables or functions initiated outside these p5.js instances **can** be accessed from within each instance. This way these canvases can share and alter the same data.

Theoretically, you could have balls bouncing around on one face of the 3D-Cube, which move over to another face once they cross the border of said face (aka instance of p5.js/HTML Canvas). If each instance uses the same methods of generating art, aka displaying/updating these balls, all you essentially have to do is push a ball's coordinates, color, size onto the next instance. 

While this data is used by p5, it is not bound to it, so for each cube side and the balls they display, you can store the data in a variable in global scope. This variable can serve as the handler for passing the balls around from one canvas to the next.

I'd like to make that work for all six faces of the 3D cube. How exactly? That's what I mean to find out.

## To the drawing table!

The fact that we're working with a 3D cube made out of canvases instead of a 2D plane doesn't make things easier. In the prototype it's pretty obious which cube face connects to which other cube face, but translating this to code is rather complex. That's where I got kinda stuck until I discussed my problem with my brother, who showed me the following:

If you imagine the cube to be made out of paper, you could simply fold the whole thing out to be a flat shape. Each cube-face/canvas-edge can be given a number. Edges that connect once the fold-out is in its 3D cube shape will have the same number. This makes it possible to track which canvas a ball moves to and from.

However, you'd still have to deal with the fact that each canvas uses their own set of coordinates. Let's say a canvas is 200 by 200 pixels. The top-left corner will correspond to **'x: 0 and y: 0'**, and the bottom-right to **'x: 199 and y: 199'**. This counts for all canvases. We're dealing with a cube, so all faces are of the same size. They will all use the same range of coordinates.

My brother suggested to keep the cube fold-out flat. In code that is, not in the visual end result. It's about the concept of it. 

The fold-out could fit into it's own grid of coordinates, with a range that encompasses all of the six cube-faces. This way you can simply use the outer-grid as an overlay for the six smaller grids-of-coordinates, which will make it so each position in all of the canvases together is unique. Since the outer grid is rectangular, and the foldout cube is not, there will be some whitespace that does not correspond to anything, it's just nothingness. These are areas where the balls cannot move through.

## Now what?

Next up I'm going to try and implement this coordinate-grid as overlay for the (imaginary) fold-out of the cube. I might even test moving a single ball from one canvas to the next. There will surely still be some unexpected issues I have to deal with, but that's fine! I do tend to learn best through experimentation and trial and error. 

If I do get stuck, I might just write another 'soc'.
