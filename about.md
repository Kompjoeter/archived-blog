# I like to go on the computer.
The computer is my all time favorite pastime thing! 

I love exploring new software, creating digital art, and playing games. Since a few years now I'm leveling up! Learning to code and making [fun, pretty and sometimes useful programs myself.](https://github.com/Kompjoeter) My interest mostly goes out to front-end development. The instant feedback of 'typing code that makes things happen on the screen' is extremely satisfying and motivating, and pushes me to get it just right.

# I like to paint, on paper and screen.

Before I got into coding, I pursued art. Even though I quit trying to make it my job, I still love it! 

Now that it has moved to my spare time activities I feel like I'm in full control and can create whatever I want. I love contrasts and can't stop creating portraits. I try to keep my process quick and effective, which greatly influences my style. One day I mean to pick up acrylic painting again, but recently [I keep myself busy with vector art.](https://www.artstation.com/paniekjonk)

# I'm neurodiverse.

Being finally diagnosed with ADHD at 27, I'm constantly developing new or improved strategies to stay optimally focused, productive yet healthy, while living in a neurotypical society. Since my diagnosis is only recent, I'm still learning, but my passion about this topic is steadily increasing. I'm very open to discussing it and hearing other people's perspectives!

Hit me up!
