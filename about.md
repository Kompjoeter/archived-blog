*"28 year old creator - currently living in the north of the Netherlands, hoping to move to the city of Zwolle. Interested in front-end development, art & design and gaining a better understanding of ADHD. Taught myself the basics of coding, now doing a study and internship."*

# I like to go on the computer.
The computer is my all time favorite pastime thing! 

I love exploring new software, creating digital art, and playing games. Since a few years now I'm leveling up! Learning to code and making [fun, pretty and sometimes useful programs myself.](https://github.com/Kompjoeter) My interest mostly goes out to front-end development. The instant feedback of 'typing code that makes things happen on the screen' is extremely satisfying and motivating and pushes me to get it just right.

Other than that, I like to experiment with vector art, usually making [illustrations](https://www.artstation.com/paniekjonk), sometimes making generative art. When I have the space for it, I mean to get back into painting, for which I've gotten a degree 'CIBAP: Art Conservation & Restoration'. I love contrasts and can't stop painting faces. I try to keep my process quick and effective, which greatly influences my style.

Being finally diagnosed with ADHD at 27, I'm constantly developing new or improved strategies to stay optimally focused, productive yet healthy, while living in a neurotypical society. Since my diagnosis is only recent, I'm still learning, but my passion about this topic is steadily increasing. I'm very open to discussing it and hearing other people's perspectives!

Hit me up!
